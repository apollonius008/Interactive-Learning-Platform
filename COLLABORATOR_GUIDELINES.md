# Guidelines For Collaborators
This is only a basic guidelines for collaborating in the project. This is not a tutorial for git and github. If you're not familiar with git, follow some tutorials and learn git so that you do not mess up. The guidelines may change as the project evolves.
### For collaborators using repository for the first time
If you do not have the repository in your local machine then follow these steps:
#### Linux and Mac Users
* Go to the location where you want to keep the project and open the terminal
* Run the command : `git clone https://github.com/apollonius008/Interactive-Learning-Platform.git`
* Now you've completed the initial setup
#### Windows users (may not be totally correct)
* Go to the location where you want to keep the project and open git bash
* Run the command : `git clone https://github.com/apollonius008/Interactive-Learning-Platform.git`
* Now you've completed the initial setup

### Workflow for collaborators
You can follow this workflow after you've completed your initial setup. This is a procedure that you follow every day while working in this project.
* Go to project directory in your local machine and open git in terminal(For Mac and Linux) or git bash(For windows)
* Make sure you're in master branch
* Type : `git pull`
* Create a new branch if you want to work on something new or switch to your old working branch
* Do not start working in the master branch or branches which are not created by you
* Do your work and commit them from time to time and write good commit messages
* After you've done some work push the branch into the orginal repository.
  * Switch to master branch
  * Type : `git push origin your_branch_name`
* Do not merge anything into the masters or branches which are not yours
* After you've completed implimenting a feature in your branch and pushed the branch, create a pull request
* If some changes are proposed in your branch, make the changes and again create a pull request again
